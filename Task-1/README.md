# Number Guessing Game (Java) – CodSoft Task 1

## About the Project
This project is a **Number Guessing Game** developed using **Java** as part of **CodSoft Internship – Task 1**.  
The program generates a random number and allows the user to guess it within a limited number of attempts.
The game is played in the console and provides feedback after each guess, helping the user understand whether the guessed number is too high or too low.

## How the Game Works
- A random number between **1 and 100** is generated
- The user gets **5 attempts** to guess the number
- After each guess, the program gives hints:
  - Too High
  - Too Low
- If the user guesses correctly, the round ends
- The user can choose to play multiple rounds
- The final score is displayed at the end

## Features
- Random number generation
- Limited number of attempts
- Multiple rounds support
- Score tracking
- User-friendly console messages

## Concepts Used
- Java Classes and Objects
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Random number generation
- Scanner class for user input
- Basic game logic

## Project Structure
Task-1
   Numbergame.java
   README.md

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java IDE or editor
2. Compile and run `Numbergame.java`
3. Guess the number by entering values between 1 and 100
4. Choose whether to continue to the next round or exit

## Learning Outcome
- Improved understanding of loops and conditionals
- Hands-on experience with random number generation
- Better control over user input handling
- Practice with game logic implementation in Java
