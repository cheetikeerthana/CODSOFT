# ATM Machine (Java) – CodSoft Task 3

## About the Project
This project is a simple **ATM Machine simulation** created using **Java** as part of **CodSoft Internship Task-3**.  
The program runs in the console and allows a user to perform basic banking operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, and checking the account balance.
The main aim of this task is to understand **Object-Oriented Programming concepts** and how different classes interact with each other in a real-world scenario.

## What This Program Does
- Takes an initial balance from the user
- Displays ATM menu options
- Allows withdrawal with balance checking
- Allows depositing valid amounts
- Shows current account balance
- Continues running until the user chooses to exit

## Concepts Used
- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- HAS-A relationship
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Scanner class for user input

## Project Files
TASK-3
     ATM_Machine.java
     README.md

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java IDE or editor
2. Compile and run the ''ATM_Machine.java' file
3. Enter the initial account balance
4. Choose options from the menu to perform operations

## Sample Operations
- Deposit money into the account
- Withdraw money (with sufficient balance validation)
- Check account balance
- Exit the ATM system

## Learning Outcome
- Better understanding of Java OOP concepts
- Practical experience with class interaction
- Improved logic building using conditions and loops
- Hands-on practice with user input validation
