# Student Grade Calculator (Java) – CodSoft Task 2

## About the Project
This project is a **Student Grade Calculator** developed using **Java** as part of the **CodSoft Java Programming Internship – Task 2**.  
The program calculates the total marks, average percentage, and final grade of a student based on the marks entered for multiple subjects.
It also checks whether the student has failed in any subject and handles invalid input values.

## How the Program Works
- The user enters the number of subjects
- Marks are entered for each subject (0–100)
- Invalid marks are rejected and re-entered
- Total marks and average percentage are calculated
- Grade is assigned based on percentage
- If the student fails in any subject, the result is marked as failed

## Features
- Accepts marks for multiple subjects
- Validates input (marks between 0 and 100)
- Calculates total marks and average percentage
- Determines grade based on percentage
- Checks subject-wise failure
- Displays clear result messages

## Grading Criteria
- A : 90% and above  
- B : 80% – 89%  
- C : 65% – 79%  
- D : 50% – 64%  
- E : 34% – 49%  
- FAIL : Below 34% or failed in any subject  

## Concepts Used
- Java Classes and Objects
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Scanner class for input handling
- Input validation
- Basic arithmetic operations

## Project Structure
Task-2
   StudentGradeCalculator.java
   README.md

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java IDE or editor
2. Compile and run `StudentGradeCalculator.java`
3. Enter the number of subjects
4. Enter marks for each subject
5. View total marks, percentage, and grade

## Learning Outcome
- Improved understanding of conditional logic
- Practice with loops and user input validation
- Hands-on experience in calculating grades
- Better understanding of basic Java program structure
