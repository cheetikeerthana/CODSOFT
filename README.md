# CodSoft Java Programming Internship

## About the Internship
This repository contains the tasks completed as part of the **CodSoft Java Programming Internship**.  
The internship focuses on strengthening core Java concepts through hands-on, console-based projects.

Each task is designed to improve problem-solving skills and understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** using Java.

## Internship Tasks Overview

###  Task 1: Number Guessing Game
